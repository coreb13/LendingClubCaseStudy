## Conclusions
- Key Risk Factors:
 ..*  Higher loan grades (E-G) show significantly higher default rates.
 ..*  Higher rates indicate higher risk profiles
 ..*  Combined high DTI and high revolving utilization indicate increased risk.
 ..*  Larger loans show slightly higher default tendency

Recommendations:
Focus on Grade A-C loans for lower risk portfolio.
Implement stricter criteria for high DTI + high utilization combinations.
Consider loan amount caps for higher risk grades.
