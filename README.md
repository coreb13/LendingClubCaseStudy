- What is the dataset that is being used?
  ... We are using loan data for all loans issued through the time period 2007 t0 2011/

## Conclusions
- Key Risk Factors:
  * Higher loan grades (E-G) show significantly higher default rates.
  * Higher rates indicate higher risk profiles
  * Combined high DTI and high revolving utilization indicate increased risk.
  * Larger loans show slightly higher default tendency

- Recommendations:
  * Focus on Grade A-C loans for lower risk portfolio.
  * Implement stricter criteria for high DTI + high utilization combinations.
  * Consider loan amount caps for higher risk grades.
